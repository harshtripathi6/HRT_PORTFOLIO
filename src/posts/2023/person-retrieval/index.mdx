## Research Motivation

Person retrieval systems must interpret **human descriptions of appearance**—such as clothing, build, or accessories—to identify individuals in surveillance footage. However, real-world datasets differ drastically: some provide **natural language descriptions (NLD)** while others contain **fixed discrete annotations (DA)**. This inconsistency limits scalability and prevents models from learning jointly from complementary sources.

Our research addresses this gap by designing a **dataset-merging framework** that transforms NLDs into DA-style, numerically encoded attributes, enabling unified training across datasets with different annotation styles.  
This work supports soft-biometric person retrieval where **faces are unavailable** and **visual identity must be inferred from descriptive traits**.

## Core Contribution

We propose a **hybrid dataset integration pipeline** that:

1. **Extracts adjective–noun attribute pairs** from natural language queries using rule-based + customized NLP parsing.
2. **Maps descriptive expressions to target soft-biometric attributes** (e.g., *"dark hair"* → *hair_color: dark*).
3. **Encodes attribute values numerically** following the AVSS schema used in surveillance datasets.
4. **Constructs a mapping matrix per description**, allowing retrieval models to index which soft-biometric traits appear in each query.
5. **Generates a unified, tabular representation** enabling joint training across datasets with different annotation formats.

This approach enables **NLD → DA conversion** while preserving descriptive nuance, giving retrieval systems access to richer language-driven variation without sacrificing structured consistency.

> <em>Example:</em> “a very slim tall man wearing blue shorts and yellow shoes”  
→ height: <em>tall</em> (3), build: <em>very slim</em> (0), skin: <em>unknown</em> (-1), torso_color: <em>unknown</em> (-1), leg_color: <em>blue</em>, footwear_color: <em>yellow</em>

## Why This Matters

Merging datasets improves **retrieval coverage, reduces bias, and enhances generalization**, but prior work lacked a programmatic solution for unifying different annotation styles.  
Our framework enables:

- **Scalable dataset growth** without manual relabeling
- **Attribute-aware person retrieval** even with vague or noisy language
- **Interoperability between NLD- and DA-style datasets**
- **Training signals that reflect how humans naturally describe people**
