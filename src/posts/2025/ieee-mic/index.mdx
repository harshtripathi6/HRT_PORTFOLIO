Self-collimation (SC) is an emerging SPECT architecture in which multi-layer detector arrays serve as both **detectors and intrinsic collimators**, bypassing the traditional trade-off between spatial resolution and sensitivity imposed by mechanical collimation. This work evaluates **Angular Sampling Completeness (ASCI)** and **Projection Probability Density Function (PPDF) sensitivity** as quantitative metrics that characterize the sampling capability and performance of SC-SPECT system designs.

Unlike conventional SPECT, SC configurations generate **spatially varying and multiplexed PPDFs**, meaning classical sampling or resolution models are insufficient. By analyzing sampling completeness and PPDF-based sensitivity across system configurations, we connect detector layout and operation mode to imaging performance.

## System Overview

We evaluate SC-SPECT systems constructed from **hexagonal MATRICS detector arrangements**, where each panel contains multiple scintillator-filled detector layers.  
This architecture naturally introduces **multiple projection paths per voxel**, enabling improved sampling density without mechanical collimators.

PPDFs are computed analytically via ray tracing, reflecting realistic spatial resolution characteristics of each detector element.  
From these PPDFs, we derive **ASCI maps** to quantify angular coverage at each location in the image space and **PPDF-based sensitivity maps** to assess detector efficiency.

## Methods

Our evaluation framework compares **three geometrical SC-SPECT configurations**, each differing in detector aperture shape and element spacing.  
For each configuration, we compute:

- **Projection Probability Density Functions (PPDFs)** to model spatial response profiles across the image space  
- **PPDF-derived strip widths (FWHM)** to characterize spatial-resolution behavior
- **Angular Sampling Completeness Index (ASCI)** to measure directional sampling coverage per pixel
- **PPDF Sensitivity** to quantify photon detection likelihood
- **Reconstructed images** from a compressed practical phantom

ASCI and PPDF metrics are assessed under both **stationary** and **rotating gantry** operation schemes to study the effect of acquisition motion on sampling quality and reconstruction performance.

## Key Findings

- **Rotational SC-SPECT designs** produce **higher and more uniform ASCI values** than stationary configurations  
- Increased ASCI correlates with **improved reconstruction resolution and artifact suppression**
- **PPDF-FWHM values** modulate effective sampling density and influence regions of weak resolution
- **PPDF sensitivity maps** provide complementary insight into photon detection efficiency and should be considered jointly with ASCI
- Combined, **ASCI and PPDF-FWHM** offer a principled basis for **predicting SC-SPECT performance prior to full reconstruction**

## Practical Insights

- Sampling completeness and resolution characteristics **depend on detector shape, aperture configuration, and acquisition motion**
- **Multiplexing effects** inherent to SC designs can be leveraged when evaluated with sampling-aware metrics
- ASCI and PPDF-based sensitivity **enable data-efficient design iteration** without exhaustive simulation

## Conclusion

ASCI and PPDF-based metrics demonstrate strong potential as **quantitative tools for characterizing and optimizing Self-Collimation SPECT designs**.  
By linking angular sampling quality and spatial resolution behavior to reconstructed imaging outcomes, these metrics support informed SC-SPECT system development and predictive design assessment.
