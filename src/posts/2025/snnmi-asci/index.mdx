Self-collimation (SC) in single-photon emission tomography introduces a new imaging paradigm: detector panels arranged in a multi-layer MATRICS configuration allow the front detector layer to simultaneously serve as a collimator for the layer behind it. Unlike traditional mechanical collimation, this architecture breaks the inherent trade-off between spatial resolution and detection sensitivity, opening opportunities for jointly improving both. However, the resulting projection probability density functions (PPDFs) are spatially non-uniform and multiplexed, making existing sampling models—designed for uniform PPDFs—insufficient for SC-SPET evaluation.

To address this gap, we developed an **angular sampling completeness index (ASCI)** that quantifies how well a system samples the image space while explicitly considering spatial-resolution variability. This metric supports SC-SPET system analysis, design iteration, and optimization by linking sampling completeness to achievable image resolution.

## Imaging Geometry & System Configuration

Our research studies a **2-D SC-SPET architecture** featuring a hexagonal gantry with six MATRICS detector panels.  
Each panel contains four detector blocks positioned tangentially, and each block comprises an **8×8 array** of detector elements. Elements are either filled with **GAGG(Ce) scintillators** or intentionally left vacant, creating controlled detection–collimation configurations.

This design produces **non-uniform PPDFs with variable strip width and multiplexing**, requiring a metric that captures sampling density as a function of spatial resolution.

---

## Methodology

We compute PPDFs analytically through ray tracing and evaluate system sampling using **ASCI**, defined as the percentage of angular bins intersected by PPDF strips at a given pixel position over 360°.  
The process measures how effectively an imaging point is sampled directionally.

We further analyze the relationship between **strip width (FWHM)** and sampling completeness, as strip width serves as a spatial sampling index tied to achievable resolution.

Two operational modes were evaluated:

1) **Stationary gantry**  
2) **Rotating gantry (24 steps at 2.5° per step)**

For both, we generate ASCI maps under varying PPDF widths and compare reconstruction outcomes using **parallelized expectation-maximization** on a Linux cluster.

## Key Findings

- **ASCI magnitude and uniformity increase with gantry rotation**, enhancing sampling completeness and reconstruction quality.
- **Strip width (FWHM)** influences ASCI distribution and correlates with achieved image resolution.
- The relationship between ASCI and reconstruction demonstrates **predictive utility for system performance modeling**.
- Combined, **ASCI + PPDF width** provide complementary metrics for **evaluating and optimizing SC-SPET designs**.

## Practical Implications

- Enables **sampling-aware system design**, guiding detector placement and rotation strategies.
- Supports **data-efficient evaluation**, reducing simulation and prototyping overhead.
- Offers a **unified metric** bridging geometry, resolution behavior, and reconstruction outcomes.

## Conclusion

This work introduces ASCI as a **resolution-dependent sampling completeness metric** for SC-SPET systems.  
By integrating spatial sampling characteristics with angular coverage assessment, ASCI enables quantitative comparisons across design configurations and operational modes. When analyzed alongside PPDF strip width, ASCI provides a principled way to predict reconstruction quality and guide SC-SPET optimization.
